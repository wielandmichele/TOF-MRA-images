# 👩‍⚕️💻 Using 3D CNNs for predicting therapy outcomes in stroke patients using TOF-MRA images. 

This repository contains the 💻 code I used in my Bachelor's thesis and is structured as follows:

- 🛠️ data preparation: Contains the code for saving the raw data (DICOM images and labels) in an HDF5 file and the data preparation steps described in the thesis (uniform image size, normalization of signal values, and dimension expansion).
- 🔍 descriptive analysis: Contains the code for analyzing the raw data.
- 📚 functions: Contains functions that were used in multiple scripts.
- 🤖 models: Contains hyperparameter optimization, 5-fold cross-validation, and ensemble models for stroke detection and outcome prediction.

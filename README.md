# 👩‍⚕️💻 Using 3D CNNs for predicting therapy outcomes in stroke patients using TOF-MRA images. This repository contains the 💻 code I used in my Bachelor's thesis.

The folders include the following:

- 📚 Functions: Contains functions that were used in multiple scripts.
- 🔍 Descriptive Analysis: Contains the code for analyzing the raw data.
- 🛠️ Data Preparation: Contains the code for saving the raw data (DICOM images and labels) in an HDF5 file and the data preparation steps described in the thesis (uniform image size, normalization of signal values, and dimension expansion).
- 🤖 Models: Contains hyperparameter optimization, 5-fold cross-validation, and ensemble models for stroke detection and outcome prediction.
